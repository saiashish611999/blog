# 📝 Blogify — A Modern Blogging Platform Built with Django

The Blog is a feature-rich, production-ready blogging platform built using **Django 5**.
After completing my beginner project “Mark it - Make it” (a ToDo app), I developed **Blogify** to master advanced Django concepts — including authentication, ORM relationships, class-based views, and reusable templates.
